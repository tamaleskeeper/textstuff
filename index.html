        <p>1. Introduction
Transformational leadership is one of the most dominant paradigms in the contemporary leadership literature (Judge and Piccolo, 2004). It is linked with several employee outcomes, such as well‐being (Nielsen et al., 2009), creativity (Shin and Zhou, 2003) and task performance (Piccolo and Colquitt, 2006). The transformational leadership style has been defined as “the process through which leaders and followers help each other to advance to a higher level of morality and motivation” (Burns, 1979, p. 21). Thus a transformational leader is a morally mature leader who motivates followers’ behaviours and attitudes to generate higher levels of moral reasoning in followers (Burns, 1979). However, transformational managers do not influence subordinates’ attitudes and behaviours in a simple way. While evidence suggest numerous mediation mechanisms through which transformational leadership affect subordinates (Sivanathan et al., 2004), Avolio et al. (2009) found that the process of influence (or the mechanism) through which transformational managers motivate subordinates needed further investigation.
Recently, the relationship between transformational leadership and employee engagement at work has attracted much scholarly attention (Zhu et al., 2009; Salanova et al., 2011). Specifically, Schaufeli and Bakker (2004) refers to engagement as a “positive, fulfilling, work related state of mind that is characterised by vigour, dedication and absorption” (p. 295). The empirical findings from studies on the relationship between transformational leadership and work engagement suggest that the mechanism of influence has not been adequately studied (Zhu et al., 2009). These researchers claim that this area should be further explored by using “other unmeasured variables that could directly or indirectly influence feelings of work engagement” (Zhu et al., 2009, p. 612).
One of the more recent conceptual articles in the engagement literature (Bakker et al., 2011) argues that the direct relationship between transformational leadership and engagement has different intensities under different conditions. They claim that such direct influence is not simple, and can result from helping employees to construe meaningfulness in work (p. 14). Meaning in work (or meaningfulness in work, as per Rosso et al., 2010) has been conceptualised widely in the literature. According to Arnold et al. (2007), meaningful work is all about “finding a purpose in work that is greater than the extrinsic outcome of the work” (p. 195). It has been stated in the literature that individuals’ primary aim is to be motivated to look for work that is meaningful, personally fulfilling and motivating (Hackman and Oldham, 1976; Chalofsky, 2003). Indeed, this perspective is evident in some of the previous work on motivational theories. For instance, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs indicates that once the lower survival needs which involves psychological, safety and social needs are met, individuals seek to address their higher order needs, which involves progressing from “belonging” to “esteem” to “self‐actualisation”. Experiencing personal meaning in work has been shown to relate closely to satisfying these higher order needs. According to Chalofsky (2003), once these needs are met, individuals will seek a job that is more meaningful and which fulfils their life purpose. Thus, individuals seek to experience meaningful work that maximises their sense of motivation. Hackman and Oldham (1976) established the interconnection of meaningful work and personal motivation, and found that meaningful work – in addition to feedback and autonomy – maximises the possibility of intrinsic motivation.
Our study aims to test the role of meaning in work as a mediator between transformational leadership and employee engagement, an aspect also highlighted by Bakker et al. (2011) as not having enough empirical scrutiny.
By examining the mediating role of perceptions of meaning in work, we hope to contribute to the literature both theoretically and practically. Theoretically, this study responds to calls by Roberts and Davenport (2002) and Shuck et al. (2011) for engagement researchers to focus on the situational drivers of engagement that can be changed over a period of time, such as the behaviours of managers and work structure. First, our findings on transformational leadership reveal that the perceptions of meaning in work promote employee feelings of work engagement differently. Second, our study also enriches the work engagement literature that transformational leadership is related to followers’ perceptions of meaning in work to affect the levels of work engagement.
Industry reports show that only one‐fifth of employees were engaged in their work, and that the engagement levels were steadily declining and costing countries greatly in lost productivity (e.g. US$300 billions annually in USA, approximately US$94.5‐103.4 billions annually in UK, and over US$232 billions annually in Japan) (Gallup, 2009). In Australia, the situation is worse. Recent estimates show that disengagement among employees has increased to more than 82 per cent, costing the Australian economy between US$37.5‐47.2 billions annually in productivity losses (Gallup, 2009). Therefore, organisations constantly need to look for fresh ways to create and then sustain higher engagement levels. Findings of our proposed relationship should help address some of these concerns by providing practitioners with guidelines for designing work contexts to promote employee engagement.
2. Literature review and hypotheses development
2.1 Work engagement: stability and definition
It is important to ensure that engagement is independent of similar concepts and has its own characteristics and measure. While some researchers have argued that work engagement is a unique motivational construct that has distinguishable characteristics from other constructs such as job satisfaction, organisational commitment or job involvement (Bakker and Leiter, 2010), the majority of practitioner study findings do not convincingly show that work engagement is different, and is only a repackaging of other constructs (Macey and Schneider, 2008). Arguably, studies have recently contended the appearance of employee engagement at work through clear and sufficient theories such as the job‐demand resource model (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004), the self‐determination theory (Meyer and Gagne, 2008) and the conservation of resources theory (Halbesleben, 2011). A detailed analysis of comparisons between work engagement and job satisfaction, organisational commitment, flow notion and job involvement can be found in Bakker and Leiter (2010), Albrecht (2010) and in Bakker et al. (2011).
Work engagement is a relatively new construct that has been conceptualised by many (Wefald et al., 2011). A commonly cited definition (Schaufeli et al., 2002) states that work engagement is a persistent and pervasive affective‐cognitive state of being characterised by vigour, dedication and absorption. Vigour refers to high energy levels and states of mental resilience while working. Dedication refers to involvement and experiencing a sense of pride and challenge. Absorption refers to being highly concentrated on and happily engrossed in work. Due to its close association with the notion of flow, researchers believe that more research is required to examine whether absorption is a core dimension or an outcome of work engagement (Bakker et al., 2011).
The current study uses Schaufeli et al.'s (2002) definition due to two reasons. First, research on engagement is relatively recent, and researchers still debate whether engagement should be practically differentiated from other related concepts. McBain (2006) claims that other definitions of engagement more heavily emphasise identification with or commitment to either the organisation or a job, and use terms such as organisational commitment and satisfaction (Wefald and Downey, 2009) and workaholism (Schaufeli et al., 2002). Hence, Schaufeli's definition of engagement has generated strong validity and appears to cover the missing elements of other definitions (Wefald and Downey, 2009; Bakker, 2009). Second, researchers commonly refer to Schaufeli's view of work engagement as a basis for research as it includes the affective and cognitive nature of employees’ perceptions of work. This line of thinking is in line with the agreement that engagement has two core dimensions, energy and involvement (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2010).
2.2 Transformational leadership
Bass (1985) cited in (Yukl, 1994) claims that transformational leadership has an additive effect on followers to do more than originally intended by “(1) making them more aware of the importance of task outcomes, (2) inducing them to transcend their own self‐interests for the sake of the organizations or team and (3) activating their higher order needs” (p. 351).
Despite this additive influence, disagreements have been raised regarding the different sub‐dimensions of transformational leadership (Rafferty and Griffin, 2004). In this sense, we followed Bass’ (1985) conceptualisation of transformational leadership (1985) involving the four sub‐dimensions referred to as the 4I's. Bass's four sub‐dimensions of transformational leadership have been proven to have construct validity in assessing transformational leadership style. Judge and Piccolo (2004) stated that there have been more studies conducted on Bass's view transformational leadership than about all the other popular theories of leadership combined.
The first transformational behaviour is idealised influence, which is a leader's ability to build loyalty and devotion without much consideration for their own self‐interest, and which also helps followers to identify with them. The second behaviour is inspirational motivation, which involves a supervisor's ability to create a vision that appeals to followers and makes them a significant part of the organisation (Bass and Riggio, 2006). The third behaviour is intellectual stimulation, which involves leaders’ ability to stimulate employees’ efforts to be innovative through questioning assumptions and taking calculated risks, so followers can think in a non‐traditional way. The final behaviour is individualised consideration. Here, leaders act as a mentor or coach paying special attention to the different needs of individuals. These four behaviours interact together and result in motivating followers’ professional characteristics (Shamir et al., 1993; Bass and Riggio, 2006).
Despite the strong association between the behaviours of transformational leadership and desirable outcomes, there has been a dearth of conceptual and empirical research on examining the role of transformational leadership on followers’ affective states (Avolio et al., 2009). As work engagement is defined as a positive affective state of the mind (Schaufeli et al., 2002), the direct relationship between transformational leadership and wok engagement can help address recent calls by Avolio et al. (2009). In this study, we provide justification for how these behaviours influence feelings of engagement.
2.3 Direct relationship between transformational leadership and work engagement
A central behaviour in the transformational leadership style involves acting as a role model supervisor displaying idealised influence behaviour. “Role model” leaders build loyalty and devotion while paying less attention to their own self‐interests (Bass and Bass, 2008). Followers strive to emulate their transformational managers because they act in ways that allow them to serve as role models for their subordinates (Bono and Judge, 2003). That is, followers who are certain of the virtues or visions of their supervisor will be less likely to resist proposals for change and more likely to perform their high risk tasks. In this context, subordinates perform effectively and are energised to sacrifice and move beyond their own self‐interests to make a better contribution towards organisational performance (Shamir et al., 1993). When leaders set themselves as examples for followers, followers’ sense of values and contributions will enhance, and as a result, engage their whole self in work.
Another behaviour of transformational leadership that could be linked to employee engagement is individualised consideration. The individualised consideration behaviour demonstrates individualised attention towards their followers by identifying and responding to followers’ demands, displaying care of individual differences and paying special attention to followers’ needs for achievement and growth (Avolio and Bass, 2002; Bass and Riggio, 2006). One of the most influential theories in organisational behaviour literature that could be used as an underlying theory to explain this relationship is the social exchange theory (SET) (Blau, 1964). This theory is developed on the premise of subjective cost‐benefit analysis and the comparison of alternatives. It indicates that the series of interactions that can occur between two parties (e.g. the manager and followers) will usually create obligations from one party to another. Therefore, a party is likely to reciprocate according to the SET.
The application of SET on the relationship between the individualised consideration behaviour and engagement can be presented as follows. When leaders demonstrate genuine consideration and care for each follower, they are more likely to motivate positive leader‐follower relationships to improve their sense of belonging to the organisation (Zhu et al., 2009). Because of their enhanced sense of belonging, a possible way for employees to reciprocate to this special attention and care is by devoting their very best effort in their work. It is believed that if a leader provides important personal resources to followers (such as care, consideration and respect), followers are likely to perceive that the workplace as supportive, and in turn help create a sense of obligation to reciprocate positively to this support. Researchers have argued that this reciprocation could be in the form of many desirable behaviours such as engagement at work (Saks, 2006). Thus far, it might be argued that individualised consideration behaviours of supervisors enhance employees’ attributes of engagement at work.
Furthermore, it can be stated that intellectually stimulating managers produce a supportive organisational climate (Avolio and Bass, 2002) which can play a role in the development of employees’ feelings of work engagement. Through this behaviour, leaders stimulate their followers’ effort to be more creative in solving problems by questioning old assumptions and solving problems depending on fresh perspectives (Bass and Bass, 2008). Bass (1985) found that transformational leaders stimulate subordinates to go beyond the basic needs to the needs of the organisational mission and purpose. In turn, followers are likely to be more innovative and make considerable contributions towards work (Shin and Zhou, 2003). When employees’ contributions to work is not criticised, transformational leaders are likely to increase the intrinsic motivation of followers, and thus increase their levels of dedication (Bass and Bass, 2008; Avolio and Bass, 2002). However, when employees perform at a high level and their efforts are not recognised, their intrinsic motivation reduces which might in turn influence their self‐esteem. Taking into account that engaged workers are highly involved and dedicated in work (Schaufeli et al., 2002), supervisors who display intellectual stimulation behaviour can influence employees’ involvement in work and thus work with high feelings of dedication, the second facet of engagement.
Engaged employees are characterised as completely concentrated and happily absorbed while doing the job (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004). More often, those employees find it hard to detach the self while working. Through inspirational motivation, supervisors create a vision of the future that appeals to subordinates and makes them a significant part of the organisation (Piccolo and Colquitt, 2006). A vision offers a picture of the future that consists of values, hopes and ideals. Inspirational motivational managers are capable of establishing and conveying high expectations that challenge and inspire subordinates to achieve more than they thought was possible (Bass and Riggio, 2006). Such motivational leaders are often expected to depend on idealistic visions and persuasive communication to influence followers to immerse themselves in their work. Shamir et al. (1993) argued that “supervisors who use verbal persuasion and emotional appeals act as a powerful source for motivating subordinates effort, therefore developing a sense of identification in subordinates with their work unit” (in Piccolo and Colquitt, 2006, p. 329). Thereby, inspirational motivational behaviour is considered to be linked to the attribute of absorption, the third facet of work engagement. Building on these justifications, we hypothesised as follows:
H1. Transformational leadership behaviours significantly predict work engagement.

2.4 Indirect relationship between transformational leadership and work engagement through meaning in work
2.4.1 Meaning in work
The main interest in meaning in work has been fuelled by the assumption that personal and organisational outcomes were associated with perceptions of meaning in work (Rosso et al., 2010). The significance of this study lies in its exploration of H1 and in its exploration of how perceptions of meaning in work mediate the transformational leadership‐work engagement relationship. Scholars have increasingly focused on meaning in work as a source of individuals’ and organisational outcomes, such as well‐being (Nielsen et al., 2008; Arnold et al., 2007), organisational commitment (Wrzesniewski, 2003), job satisfaction (Wrzesniewski et al., 1997) and absenteeism (Wrzesniewski et al., 1997). In addition, as an indication for the importance of meaning in the work, the construct of meaning in work has been found in major models, such as in the empowerment model (Spreitzer et al., 1997) and job characteristics model (Hackman and Oldham, 1976).
However, the major transformations that have occurred during the last 20 years such as demographic changes, globalisation and technological development have affected employees’ behaviours and their perceptions regarding work. In this regard, Rosso et al. (2010) indicate that researchers must be more definite about what type of meaning in work they use because earlier approaches for defining meaning may no longer be appropriate with these recent changes. Indeed, Scroggins (2008) claim that although the meaning in work has appeared in several models, the construct has only recently received interest in the organisational behavioural literature. Hence, researchers need to be more deliberate about what type of meaning in work they are addressing because varying conceptualizations in the literature have resulted in development issues of the construct (Rosso et al., 2010).
In our effort to address these issues, we reviewed some of the influential studies that examined the role of meaning in work in the last ten years (Chalofsky, 2003; Pratt and Ashforth, 2003; May et al., 2004; Wrzesniewski, 2003; Rosso et al., 2010). From this review, we can claim that perceptions of meaning in work are mainly based on the interactions and subjective interpretations of work experience that employees experience in the work environment (Rosso et al., 2010). Moreover, we assume that employees perceive meaning in work when work has a goal, purpose and value that is connected to the employee and his ability to construct meaning in work (Chalofsky, 2003; Arnold et al., 2007), and when there is an interactional relationship between employees’ values and goals on the one hand and organisational and work values and goals on the other (Pratt and Ashforth, 2003; May et al., 2004).
Meaning in work is considered as a mediator between transformational leadership and work engagement if two conditions are met (Baron and Kenny, 1986). First, transformational leadership must be related with both meaningful work and employee engagement. Second, the introduction of meaningful work into the analysis must reduce the initially observed link between transformational leadership and employee engagement. The only way to investigate whether both conditions are met is to assess them in a statistical manner. We have already reviewed the relevant literature on the relationship between transformational leadership and employee engagement. The following two sections will identify the relationship between transformational leadership and meaningful work and the relationship between meaningful work and employee engagement.
2.4.2 Transformational leadership and meaning in work
Chalofsky (2003) describes employees who fail to find meaning in work as those who have high feelings of rejection, prejudice or misunderstanding. We argue that in an environment where supervisors possess transformational behaviours, such feelings might be diminished or may even be non‐existent by creating perceptions of meaning in work. For example, through the use of intellectual stimulation, leaders can stimulate subordinates to create solutions for the problems and to be openly creative (Shin and Zhou, 2003). In an environment, where leaders are intellectually stimulated, followers’ self‐esteem will be enhanced (Shamir et al., 1993). Thus, they feel safe to express their opinions without fear of criticism if they contribute something that is incorrect. This specific behaviour might help followers to control their environment where feelings of rejection, prejudice or misunderstanding prevents meaning in work to appear. This is in line with Scroggins (2008) who claims “consistency between work experiences and the individual's perception of self may enhance self‐esteem, which will also make the work more meaningful” (p. 70).
Furthermore, it can be argued that perceiving meaning in work not only concerns rewards an employee attracts for performance, but meaning in work also forms the link between purpose and values (Chalofsky, 2003; Arnold et al., 2007). Supervisors who develop specific missions, goals and identities for organisations are able to influence subordinates’ perceptions to perceive work as meaningful. Through inspirational motivation, transformational leaders are seen as having a compelling vision of the future, and communicating optimism about future goals, which in turn increases followers’ personal core values (Nielsen et al., 2008; Piccolo and Colquitt, 2006; Bono and Judge, 2003; Spreitzer et al., 1997). Consistency between managers’ vision of the organisation's mission and the core values of their subordinates are more likely to appear. Thus, subordinates are likely to perceive the work to be more purposive, motivational and important – all of which are integral components of perceiving meaning in work (Chalofsky, 2003). Thus, greater supervisors’ display of transformational leadership behaviours, followers’ perception of meaning in work is likely to increase. Accordingly, we hypothesised as follows:
H2a. Transformational leadership influences employees’ perceptions of meaning in work.

2.4.3 Meaning in work and work engagement
The body of literature on meaning in work and work engagement indicated the relationship between both terms but with some contradictions. Work engagement has been studied in both directions: either as an antecedent variable to appearance of meaning in work or as a consequence for finding meaning in work. On one hand, some supported the idea that perceiving meaning in work is an intrinsic motivational factor that predicts characteristics of work engagement (May et al., 2004). Others found meaning in work as an antecedent to work engagement (Mendes and Stander, 2011). Some also have suggested that during times spent in work when the employee is being engaged, employees may come to value the work they do and be more aware about the significance and values of the work roles (Gallup, 2009). Employees may actively change the design of their jobs by choosing tasks, negotiating different job content and assigning meaning to their tasks or jobs (Bakker and Leiter, 2010, p. 190).
We follow the first party and hypothesised as follows:

H2b. Employees’ perceptions of meaning in work positively predict employees’ work engagement.

Altogether, the degree to which managers create meaning in work may differ. Specifically, it has been justified that managers who posses transformational leadership style motivate followers to look beyond everyday activities for the sake of the organisation. Those managers not only present an impressive future for employees, these managers also demonstrate for employees’ how they can work towards a better future in their current job. This connection between employees’ current work and a desirable future can instil meaning into the employees’ work. In that case, employees derive more perceptions that work is a meaningful place. With this gap in knowledge, it can be concluded that meaning in work can act as a possible mediator on the transformational leadership‐work engagement relationship. Accordingly, we hypothesised as follows:

H3. Perceptions of meaning in work mediate the association between transformational leadership and work engagement.

The above discussion is captured in Figure 1.
3. Methods
3.1 Sample and procedures for data collection
A total of 4,200 e‐mail invitations to complete a web‐based questionnaire were sent out via a professional survey company based in Sydney, Australia. The invitation letter also described the aims and objectives of the study, data collection, potential contribution, potential use of the research and how confidentiality would be maintained and privacy protected. The participants constituted a sample of full‐time employees working under a direct supervisor in various sectors in Australia. Employees who have a part‐time job were excluded from this study because they would have different perceptions of and attitudes about the study variables from full‐time employees. Five hundred and thirty participant responses were usable for this study. Twenty‐five incomplete questionnaires were eliminated from the study, resulting in an overall response rate of 12.9 per cent. Because our response rate is relatively low, we found it helpful to provide some comparison between answers of respondents and non‐respondents. Independent sample t‐test and one‐way ANOVA were performed to assess this concern. On the basis of the results, it can be cautiously concluded that there were no significant statistical differences between respondents and non‐respondents with respect to their demographic characteristics (p>0.05). The demographic profile of the participants is presented in Table I.
3.2 Measures
The measures used for the variables of the study are outlined below.

3.2.1 Transformational leadership
We used the Global Transformational Leadership Scale (GTL) to assess the four behaviours of transformational leadership (Carless et al., 2000). The literature has regularly reported GTL's acceptable internal consistency. Carless et al. (2000) reported strong evidence that the seven‐item GTL is highly reliable (α=0.93), have strong validity evidence which should have substantial utility value (Carless et al., 2000). Carless et al. (2000) have reported that the factor loadings of the seven items are above the required 0.50 cut‐off value which ranged from 0.78 to 0.88 with a mean of 0.84 (SD=0.05). Respondents were asked to rate their immediate supervisor in the current work situation by indicating the extent to which their supervisors engaged in behaviours of transformational leadership. The response format of the GTL ranges from 1 (not at all) to 5 (frequently, if not always). Examples for these items include “My supervisor communicates a clear and positive vision of the future”. The lower the scores reported by the participants, the lower they perceived their immediate supervisors as possessing transformational characteristics.
3.2.2 Work engagement
We employed the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES‐17) to measure work engagement. The scale is composed of three subscales, each measuring one facet of work engagement. The three sub‐dimensions of UWES‐17 has good psychometric qualities, and is able to measure the dimensions of employee engagement without the length of the scale (17 items) influencing participants (Bakker, 2009). The results of the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) revealed that the UWES‐17 is a sufficient and clear three‐factor model to measure employee engagement at work (Bakker, 2009; Bakker and Demerouti, 2008; Schaufeli and Bakker, 2010). Attributes of work engagement was measured by asking participants to report their preference on a seven‐point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 6 (always). The higher the score reported by the employee, the greater they felt engaged at work. Examples for these items included “At my work, I feel bursting with energy” and “I am enthusiastic about my job”.
3.2.3 Meaning in work
We used May et al.'s (2004) scale to assess meaning in work. May et al. (2004) found that this scale has good psychometric qualities with a high reliability of the scale (α=0.90). Results of the factor analyses lend support to the discriminant validity of this measure and did not suggest that common method variance was a problem in the data. We measured participants’ perceptions of meaning in work by asking employees to rate their perceptions of six items on a five‐point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The lower the score reported by the follower, the lower they perceive meaning in work. This scale included items such as “My job activities are personally meaningful to me”.

3.2.4 Demographic profile
Employees were asked to provide information about their age, gender, academic background, the industry they presently work, hours worked per week, duration of service at work and the duration of service under the supervisor at the time of data collection.

3.3 Procedures for data analysis
A major recommended approach in conducting SEM is the two‐step modelling approach developed by Anderson and Gerbing (1988). In the first stage, researchers identify how well each underlying indicator and error is included in the model (see Figure 2). This stage tests the reliability, factor loading and goodness‐of‐fit for each scale of the study. The researchers in the second stage, namely the structural model stage, focus on the overall relationship between constructs by specifying how each construct appears in the model. The rationale for this approach is that accurate representation of the reliability of the indicators is best accomplished in two‐stages to avoid the interactions between measurement and the structural model (Diamantopoulos et al., 2000).
Preacher and Hayes (2004) acknowledge that the simple mediation model appears when the independent variable (X) affects a dependent variable (Y) through a mediator (M). The total effect of X on Y represents the total effect (c). The direct effect of X on Y after the addition of M is expressed as (c′). Path (a) represents the effect of X on M and path (b) represents the effect of M on Y controlling for the effect of X. The indirect effect between Y and X is defined as ab. In most cases, the indirect effect (ab) represents the difference between the c and c′ (ab=c−c′) and thus the total effect (c) can be calculated as the sum of c and ab (c=c′+ab). As a rule of thumb, a partial mediated model is supported when the value of indirect effect path (ab) is smaller than the value of total effect path (c) with the same sign.

The causal‐steps approach developed by Baron and Kenny (1986) is the most cited approach to test simple mediation (MacKinnon and Fairchild, 2009; Hayes, 2009). Although it is widely used, it suffers from several limitations such as lower ability to detect the mediation effect and the inability to explicitly quantify the magnitude of the mediation effect. The limitations in this method makes it fallible to testing hypotheses (MacKinnon and Fairchild, 2009; Hayes, 2009).
As another option, researchers show that the bootstrapping approach is a more valid and powerful method for testing explicitly the mediation effects and, for this reason; it should be the method of choice in mediation analysis (Hayes, 2009). In this study, we used SEM which involves the bootstrapping function in AMOS software for two reasons. First, it uses number of goodness of indices that help in assessing whether the hypothesised model fits the observed data to meet the two‐step approach developed by (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988). Second, SEM allows testing a mediating hypothesis, rather than separate regression analyses for testing them. The Maximum likelihood estimation method, used as a default in SEM with AMOS, simultaneously calculates all model paths together (Byrne, 2010).
The bootstrapping approach is a nonparametric method for assigning measures of accuracy to sample estimates (Hayes, 2009). Preacher and Hayes (2004) argued that the value of bootstrapping outweighs other methods for three reasons. First, it does not impose the assumption of normality on the statistical distribution of the sample. Second, this approach can be applied to small samples with confidence. Finally, the bootstrapping method circumvents the power problem introduced by asymmetries and other forms of non‐normality in the sampling distribution of ab.

4. Analysis of results and hypotheses testing
4.1 Descriptive statistics and correlation test
Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients and Cronbach's α for all the study variables are highlighted in Table II.
From Table II, it can be generalised that based on references cut‐off points for correlation (Cohen, 1992), the magnitude of Pearson's correlation coefficient revealed that there is a high correlation between constructs. No weak or moderate correlation was found between constructs at the 0.01 significant levels. This might give preliminary evidence to support the hypotheses of the study.
4.2 First step: measurement model
After conducting the correlation test, we applied Anderson and Gerbing's (1988) two steps of SEM. To do so, scale fit indices and factor loading needed to be checked. Incremental (comparative fit index, Tucker fit index and normed fit indices), absolute (χ2, χ2/df, p‐value, goodness‐of‐fit index and adjusted goodness‐of‐fit index) and badness‐of‐fit indices (standardised root mean residual and root mean square error of approximation) that applied in this study were used according to the recommendations of Hu and Bentler (1999) and Byrne (2010).
Consistent with previous research, we averaged the seven items to create a single index to measure transformational leadership (Arnold et al., 2007). The fit indices showed that the higher‐order factor of the model fitted the data adequately: χ2=68.807, χ2/df=4.915, p=0.000, GFI=0.96, AGFI=0.93, CFI=0.98, TLI=0.98, NFI=0.98, RMSEA=0.086 and SRMR=0.018. Results of the CFA reveal that the seven dimensions were significantly loaded on the transformational leadership construct (β=0.82 to 0.89; α=95 per cent).

For work engagement, scale fit indices show that work engagement indicated an adequately acceptable fit (χ2=292.53, χ2/df=4.7, GFI=0.92, AGFI=0.88, CFI=0.96, TLI=0.95, NFI=0.95, RMSEA=0.048 and SRMR=0.027). Results of the second‐order CFA reveal that the three factors significantly loaded onto a higher‐order construct of work engagement (β=0.97‐0.99; α=95 per cent). Thus, a higher‐order factor of work engagement was utilised in the statistical analysis.

The six items assigned for measuring meaning in work were averaged to create a single index tapping of meaning in work (May et al., 2004). Conducting CFA reveals that the scale fitted the data adequately (GFI=0.96, AGFI=0.91, CFI=0.98, TLI=0.97, NFI=0.98, RMSEA=0.70 and SRMR=0.019). Furthermore, results show that the six items significantly loaded onto the meaning in work construct with (β=0.81‐0.88; α=94 per cent).

One can conclude from the discussion above that the loading of items on each constructs were valid and above the preferred 0.50 threshold of acceptability. All values for the loadings are significant at p>0.001. Furthermore, each scale was with Cronbach's α above the preferred 0.70 requirements of acceptability.

4.3 Second step: structural model
Results from the CFA provided evidence that the hypothesised model fits the data adequately (χ2=243, χ2/df=2.8, GFI=0.94, AGFI=0.92, RMSEA=0.085, SRMR=0.022; CFI=0.98; TLI=0.98; NFI=0.97). Hence, both steps have been met.

4.4 Hypotheses testing
In SEM, it is always necessary to assess whether the collected data violate certain key assumptions. Multicollinearity and normality were checked for this reason. Results of Tolerance value and variance inflation factor revealed that they were in the satisfactory area indicating no multicollinearity, whereas the skewness value was in the range for all constructs (−0.55 to −0.96) indicating an approximately normal distribution.

Figure 2 displays the output of SEM analysis. As can be seen, the standardised coefficient for total effect (c) of transformational leadership on work engagement before entering the mediator was significant with (β=0.686; p<0.001). This means that hypothesis 1 is fully supported. . Furthermore, we can see from Figure 2 that when meaning in work acts as a mediator, the influence of transformational leadership on engagement remains significant but reduces to reach (β=0.217; p<0.001). We can also lend support for H2a and H2b that there is a significant direct influence of transformational leadership on meaning in work (β=0.69; p<0.001), and that there is a significant direct influence of meaning in work on work engagement (β=0.68; p<0.001).

Finally, on the indirect effects of H3, the bootstrapping procedure in AMOS was used and performed with 5,000 resamples. Statistical significance for the indirect effect was determined from 99 per cent bias and accelerated confidence intervals (Hayes, 2009). This indicates that meaning in work transmits almost (β=0.47; p<0.001) of the influence of transformational leadership on work engagement with 99 per cent confidence. We can conclude that the indirect effect of meaning in work is significantly different from zero at p<0.001.

As predicted, the results lend support to a partial mediation model since the total effect of transformational leadership on work engagement attenuated slightly but remained significant when controlling meaning in work.

AMOS provides the squared multiple correlation (R2) for each observed variable's rating. Each R2 can be interpreted as the proportion of the total variance in an observed rating that is explained by all variables that the rating directly depends on. As can be seen from the model presented in Figure 2, large proportions of the variance in our variables can be explained. Transformational leadership explains 43 per cent of the variance in meaning in work while 64 per cent of the variance in work engagement is explained by transformational leadership and meaning in work.
5. Discussion
As predicted, the direct relationship between transformational leadership and work engagement in H1 was supported. First, the findings demonstrate that employees who have transforming managers are more likely to be energetic, dedicated and absorbed in work. The results of this hypothesis among Australian employees is in line with previous studies conducted in South Africa (Zhu et al., 2009), the Netherlands (Tims et al., 2011) and Portugal (Salanova et al., 2011). Second, this study identified that transformational leadership creates meaning in work that followers do (as hypothesised in H2a) and that meaning in work also predicts work engagement (as expected in H2b). Finally, the results of H3 lend support to a partial mediation of meaning in work between transformational leadership and work engagement. These results address Bakker et al.'s (2011) conceptual claims that meaning in work might mediate the relationship between transformational leadership and work engagement. In this regard, we extend previous research findings in meaning in work to explain the indirect portion of the influence from transformational leadership on work engagement.
5.1 Implications for practice
We argue that relationships presented in the current study play a significant role in halting losses from low figures of employee engagement by providing two practical implications.

From the results of the direct influence, we suggest that human resource (HR) managers who aim to generate levels of employee engagement on the long term, to offer new programmes and training workshops that improve transformational leadership behaviours (Nielsen and Cleal, 2011). We argue that these programmes, in turn, can address employees’ needs and interests thus helping to reduce the financial looses mentioned earlier from lack of engagement. Although this study highlighted the mediating role of meaning in work between transformational leadership and work engagement, previous studies (e.g. Saks, 2006) have found that employee engagement mediates the relationship between different antecedents and job satisfaction, organisational commitment and intentions to quit all of which are considered as motivators to limit financial losses.
The results of mediation indicate that by training managers on transformational leadership style and how to deal with different working conditions at different levels in the organisation, meaning in work is likely to be enhanced whilst reducing the percentage of disengaged employees. Previous studies have confirmed that transformational leadership behaviours can be trained and learned (Barling et al., 1996; Nielsena and Munir, 2009). These interventions could involve designing work tasks to make it more meaningful to align with employees’ perceptions and interests. Moreover, by having the ability to design work with different resources such as socio‐emotional, physical and economic resources, the employees perceive consistency between work experience and self which will enhance self‐esteem, and result in more meaningful work (Scroggins, 2008). Based on the SET, Saks (2006) found that when such conditions exist in the workplace, employees will reciprocate by being more engaged.
5.2 Limitations and recommendations for future research
This study suffers from several limitations. Because this study used self‐report surveys to generate responses from different employees, there is a chance that information provided was biased on answers that were provided on the basis of being socially desirable. Fisher (1993) confirms that social desirability in answering social science questions lead to misleading conclusions. Although the procedures applied ensured minimum opportunities for this bias, there is still a possibility that employees responded in a socially desirable manner favouring their behaviours because expecting negative consequences from negative responses. Thus, we recommend future studies to test the hypothesised conceptual model by using different data collection approaches. A useful approach would be to rate employees’ work engagement and supervisors’ transformational leadership style from both parties, i.e. managers and employees. By doing so, we can reduce the probability of social desirable bias, where reliability can be attributed to the results of the hypothesised model.
Another possible limitation in this study was related to the cross‐sectional design in data collection. The cross‐sectional study approach compared with the longitudinal approach does not allow the examination of data collection with a higher degree of confidence. Thus, it would be interesting for future research to replicate findings of the study using longitudinal analysis in order to draw more consistent and accurate explanations to the causal influence of the constructs, and to see whether this hypothesised model would change over time.

It is also important to note that the 4I's of the transformational leadership is better measured by the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire developed by Bass. The GTL scale was used to rate the four behaviours of transformational leadership because of the costs associated with the MLQ survey. Studies in the transformational leadership literature have argued that GTL dimensions are valid and reliable in assessing these 4I's dimensions (Nielsen et al., 2008). The limitation of using the GTL survey comes from the fact that we could not assess which specific transformational leadership behaviour had the largest impact on work engagement and meaning in work. As testing the influential role of each behaviour of transformational leadership was beyond the aims of this study, we leave it for future research to examine the specific influences of the 4I's defined by (Bass, 1985) on the three dimensions of work engagement defined by (Schaufeli et al., 2002).
Finally, we recommend future studies to improve our proposed conceptual model by including additional mediators (e.g. trust in manager) or moderators (e.g. personal environment fit) that might provide more rigour to the model. The inclusion of additional variables should help to build a more comprehensive model. It could provide managers with critical information to develop new strategies to influence and then enhance engagement levels of employees.

Among these notable improvements for the conceptual links is the extent to which employees trust in their managers. Future studies can test the process underpinning the direct relationship between transformational leadership and followers’ perceptions of meaning in work. In the current study, we found evidence that transformational leadership strongly predict these perceptions. Recently though, Rosso et al. (2010) claim that either physical or social processes can play a role in the relationship between antecedents (such as transformational leadership) and perceptions of meaning in work. One process that can be used to refine this relationship is the trust that employees hold for supervisors. Trust in the direct manager should particularly play an important role when evaluating transformational leadership effectiveness (Bass, 1985). Our recommendations for this variable is further reinforced on the BlessingWhite (2008) report which showed that only 28 per cent employees trust their managers. By studying the mediation role of trust between transformational leadership and meaning in work, scholars can help improve the theoretical underpinnings in the literature and develop an additional process that helps enhancing levels of employee engagement at work.
Future studies could also focus on the role of the personal environment fit in this proposed model. Shuck et al. (2011) found that employees with high perceptions of fit with their current job influence the extent to which they are engaged at work. However, limited research, if any, has focused on the role of perceptions of job/fit with meaningful work. Understanding to what extent the perceptions of meaning in work is affected or moderated by the personal environment fit factor would be useful. If employees do not fit the goals of an organisation, this might influence the nature of the mediating effect that we have found in the study. Future studies can extend this model by understanding the role of personal environment fit as a moderator between meaning in work and work engagement.</p>
